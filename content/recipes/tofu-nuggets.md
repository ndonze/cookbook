## Ingredients

- 1 package extra firm tofu
  - For best results, freeze overnight, thaw (will take most of the day on the counter), and drain (press with a clean towel or with a tofu press to remove water)
  - Cut into nugget-sized bites
- 1/2 cup bread crumbs
  - Panko works well for extra crunch
  - We typically use Italian Panko bread crumbs. Be mindful of ingredients because many bread crumbs contain eggs
- 2 tbsp corn starch
- 2 tbps nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp cracked black pepper
- 1/4 flour
  - We use whole wheat flour. White flour will work as well
- 1/3 cup non-dairy milk
- Neutral oil (e.g. olive oil) to spritz nuggets before air frying

## Instructions

1. Cut tofu into nugget-sized bites. Mix with flour in a bowl
1. In another bowl, mix together bread crumbs, corn starch, nutritional yeast, salt, and black pepper
1. In a third bowl, pour the non-dairy milk
1. Coat each nugget in non-dairy milk. Then, coat in bread crumb mixture
1. Once all nuggets are coated, preheat air fryer to 375 degrees F
1. Spritz the outside of the nuggets with a little oil. Olive oil cooking spray works well for this
1. Air fry nuggets for 18-20 minutes
